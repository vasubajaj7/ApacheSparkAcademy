## Code Example

Write pyspark from end to end to read data from a S3 location. Files will be in CSV format and will be skewed. Use optimization techniques to read data and transform data. Write data in parquet format with max 2 files per partition

```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, rand, row_number
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("S3DataProcessing") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read data from S3 location (replace 's3://your_bucket/your_path' with actual S3 path)
df = spark.read.csv("s3://your_bucket/your_path", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Assuming 'key' column represents the skewness, identify skewed keys
skewed_keys_df = df.groupBy("key").count().filter(col("count") > 1000)

# Repartition the DataFrame based on the identified skewed keys
skewed_keys = skewed_keys_df.select("key").collect()
skewed_keys_list = [row["key"] for row in skewed_keys]
df_repartitioned = df.repartitionByRange(len(skewed_keys_list), "key")

# Apply transformations
df_transformed = df_repartitioned.withColumn("new_column", col("old_column") + 1)

# Write data to Parquet format with a maximum of 2 files per partition
df_transformed \
    .coalesce(2) \
    .write \
    .parquet("s3://your_bucket/output_path", mode="overwrite")

# Stop SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

**In this script:
1.	We initialize a SparkSession.
2.	We read the data from the S3 location using spark.read.csv().
3.	We identify skewed keys in the DataFrame by counting occurrences of each key and filtering based on a threshold (in this case, 1000).
4.	We repartition the DataFrame based on the identified skewed keys using repartitionByRange().
5.	We apply any necessary transformations to the DataFrame.
6.	We write the transformed data to Parquet format using write.parquet(), with a maximum of 2 files per partition achieved by coalesce(2).
7.	Finally, we stop the SparkSession
